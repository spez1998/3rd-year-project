- Unmounted driver exhibits classic subwoofer behaviour - resonant frequency within 10-100Hz range before an increasingly damped response for frequencies above resonance as only the driver's moving mass dictates behaviour above resonance.
- Mounted driver exhibits higher resonant frequency and lower group delay - addition of box effectively acts like a spring, raising the compliance of the system and therefore quickening its response to a signal.
- Linkwitz Transform extends low frequency response of the system whilst also improving further the group delay of the system, therefore is better than just moving the poles of the system. At sub-15Hz, the simulated response wouldn't be possible to achieve in real-life due to massive current and air displacement requirements (only a 6-inch subwoofer).
- Simulink can be used to test if Xmax is being obeyed or not
- Designing the enclosure is a balance between size limits, power requirements, and effects on the system's response by the box:
  - Thick MDF is the best material to use - recommended by Linkwitz and others (check).
  - Minimise size for ergonomic gains and cost of materials savings.
  - Minimise power consumption to reduce amplifier cost and power losses in voice coil(s).
  - New resonant frequency should fall within 10-100Hz range for easier equalisation.
- TO DO:
  - Measure response of loudspeaker-in-a-box system in anechoic chamber to verify that it sounds good and Linkwitz Transform is working as intended.
  - Closed-loop stuff
