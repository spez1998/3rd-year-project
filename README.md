# Sujit's 3rd Year Project
Welcome to my 3rd year project! This is a centralisation of all the files of my 3rd year project for backup/sync purposes, as well as an opportunity to showcase what I am doing.

The current title is, "Exploring and Combining different Motional Feedback Techniques for a Loudspeaker". For more information on what this means, please read my [project initialisation document](PID/PID_ela17sm.pdf) which gives you an overview of the background theory surrounding loudspeakers, and the motivation for undertaking this project.

I plan to try and make the repository into a complete showcase for all the work that I will conduct over the coming year. Expect MATLAB and LTSPICE simulations, build pictures, circuit boards, and hopefully a better understanding of loudspeakers!
