# Sujit's 3rd Year Project
What started off as a simple backup and sync repository has now become a showcase for my work, aimed at the casual observer who may not have a background in electrical and electronic engineering.

## Introduction
The ultimate aim of all equipment used to reproduce audio is that whatever has been recorded should be played exactly as it was recorded. This is a difficult task to achieve, since nothing that currently exists responds completely evenly across all of the frequencies that it's expected to operate in. This phenomenon of even response across a frequency range is known as linearity. Careful design allows us to come close to linearity - one of the mathematical techniques used is to model the equipment as abstract systems with 'transfer functions' that describe the way the system performs across a frequency range. The art of an engineer building this equipment is to 'control' the system effectively. Controlling the system is the process of feeding a portion of the output back to the input, in order to compensate for errors that have occured, are currently occuring, and will occur.

Loudspeakers, especially subwoofers, aren't very linear - and even worse, they are never controlled in the manner described above (apart from experimental demonstrations). This means that only very expensive models will ever be close to linear, and cheaper systems that we commonly use in our daily lives don't perform well at all.

Thus, the goal of this project is to investigate different methods of controlling loudspeakers that have been conducted experimentally, combine as many of them as possible, and build an inexpensive subwoofer system that responds as well as an expensive model.

## Milestones
I plan to try and make the repository into a complete showcase for all the work that I will conduct over the coming year. Expect MATLAB and LTSPICE simulations, build pictures, circuit boards, and hopefully a better understanding of loudspeakers!
